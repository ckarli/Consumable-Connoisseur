# Consumable Connoisseur

This add-on intelligently updates a macro with your best available food, water, potions, healthstones, and bandages.

Stop dragging new consumables to your action bars every few levels, when you run with a new Warlock, do a Heroic in Area 52, or do some PvP.

## Features

🤖 **Auto-Updating**: Never manually replace a consumable on your bar again.

🧠 **Zone Aware**: Prioritizes Battleground-specific consumables (like Arathi Basin Runecloth Bandages) when you are in the correct zone.

💬 **Accurate Tooltips**: What You See Is What You Get. No more shoehorned macros that don't show the correct tooltips or item counts.

⏩ **Performance Optimized**: Only updates when inventory changes or combat ends.

## Setup

**Easy Setup:** Just drag these macros to your action bar once. As you loot new items, level up, or enter a Battleground, the addon updates the macro in the background.

1. Install the addon.
2. Log in.
3. Open your Macro window (`/macro` or `/m`).
4. Look for macros named `- Food`, `- Water`, etc.
5. Drag them to your bars.
6. Done, never think about consumables again. (=

*Note: If you run out of a specific consumable type, the macro will default to a fallback icon.*
