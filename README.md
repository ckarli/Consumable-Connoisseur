# Connoisseur

This add-on automatically scans your bags and updates consumable macros with the best item available for your current situation.

Whether you just leveled up, picked up a stack of conjured water, traded for a Healthstone, or just zoned into Tempest Keep or Warsong Gulch, your buttons are always ready. It can even prioritize food that keeps you "Well Fed" if your buff drops off.

## Features

![Consumable-Connoisseur](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/326eb93f-329f-4967-b750-909011a05b01)

🤖 **Auto-Updating** : Macros update instantly when you loot items, trade, level up, or change zones.

🦺 **Safety First** : Toggle "Prioritize Buff Food" with a single click to stop wasting expensive stats on simple healing. You can also quickly add items (like pet food) to the Ignore List directly from the minimap menu.

🧠 **Zone Aware** : Prioritizes Battleground-specific consumables (like Arathi Basin Runecloth Bandages) when you are in the correct zone.

💬 **Perfect Tooltips** : What You See Is What You Get. No more shoehorned macros that don't show the correct tooltips or item counts.

⏩ **Optimized** : Light-weight, but also only updates when inventory changes or combat ends.

## Setup

**Easy Setup:** Just drag these macros to your action bar once. As you loot new items, level up, or enter a Battleground, the addon updates the macro in the background.

1. Install the addon.
2. Log in.
3. Open your Macro window (`/macro` or `/m`).
4. Look for macros named `- Food`, `- Water`, etc.
5. Drag them to your bars.
6. Done, never think about consumables again. (=

*Note: If you run out of a specific consumable type, the macro will default to a fallback icon.*
