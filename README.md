# Connoisseur

This add-on automatically scans your bags and updates consumable macros with the best item available for your current situation.

Whether you just leveled up, traded for a Healthstone from a new warlock, or just zoned into Tempest Keep  -- your buttons are always ready. 

Connoisseur can even prioritize food that keeps you "Well Fed" if your buff drops off.

## Features

🤖 **Automatic** : Macros update instantly when you loot items, level up, or change zones.

🦺 **Safety First** : You can easily add items (like pet food) to the Ignore List directly from the minimap menu.

🧠 **Zone Aware** : Prioritizes Battleground-specific consumables (like Arathi Basin Runecloth Bandages) when you are in the correct zone.

💬 **Perfect Tooltips** : What You See Is What You Get. No more shoehorned macros that don't show the correct tooltips or item counts.

⏩ **Optimized** : Light-weight, but also only updates when inventory changes or combat ends.

🗺️ **Localized** : Works with all Classic WoW Locales (enUS, deDE, esES, esMX, frFR, koKR, ptBR, ruRU, zhCN, zhTW).

## Automatically Conjour Relevant Items

For Mages and Warlocks, Right-Click on your Food, Water, Mana Gem, or Healthstone macros to make more.

And by simply targeting a lower-level player, when you Right-click on the macro, you'll conjour items useful to that player.

## Setup

**Easy Setup:** Just drag these macros to your action bar once. As you loot new items, level up, or enter a Battleground, the addon updates the macro in the background.

1. Install the addon.
2. Log in.
3. Open your Macro window (`/macro` or `/m`).
4. Look for macros named `- Food`, `- Water`, `- Mana Gem`, etc.
5. Drag them to your bars.
6. Done, never think about consumables again. (=

*Note: If you run out of a specific consumable type, the macro will default to a fallback icon.*
