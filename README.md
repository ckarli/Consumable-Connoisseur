# Consumable-Connoisseur

Stop dragging new water and food ranks to your action bars every few levels.

Consumable Connoisseur is a lightweight, "set it and forget it" addon that automatically manages your consumable buttons. It scans your inventory and updates specific macros to always use the best possible item available to you based on your character's level, current zone, and item count.

## How It Works

The addon automatically creates and maintains the following macros in your General or Character specific macro tab:

*  Food & Water: Picks the food & drink that will return the most health or mana, prioritizing conjured items if you have them.
*  Health Potion: Uses the highest healing potion or injector.
*  Mana Potion: Uses the highest mana potion, injector, or gem.
*  Bandage: Uses the best bandage, including zone-specific Battleground bandages (e.g., Warsong Gulch Silk Bandage, or Bottled Nethergon Energy).
*  Healthstone: Uses the best Healthstone and accurately shows the right tooltip, no matter how many talents they put in.

Easy Setup: Just ust drag these macros to your action bar once. As you loot new items, level up, or enter a Battleground, the addon updates the macro in the background.

## Features

Smart Detection: Checks IsUsableItem to ensure you never get a "You can't use that yet" error.

Zone Aware: Prioritizes Battleground-specific consumables (like Arathi Basin Runecloth Bandages) when you are in the correct zone.

Contextual Tooltips: The macro icon and tooltip update in real-time to show exactly which item will be used next.

Zero Configuration: No options menu required. Just install and play.

Performance Optimized: Only updates when inventory changes or combat ends; zero CPU impact during raids or PVP combat.

## Installation

Install the addon.

Log in.

Open your Macro window (/macro).

Look for macros named `- Food`, `- Water`, etc.

Drag them to your bars!

Note: If you run out of a specific item, the macro will default to a fallback icon and print a message if clicked.
